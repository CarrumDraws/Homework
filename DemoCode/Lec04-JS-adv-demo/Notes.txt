What is "this?"
The this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. 
Its value depends on the context in which it is used.

Outside: The Global Object
In a Function: The Global Object
In an Object Method: The Object itself
In an Arrow Function: Retains the "this" value of the surrounding scope

Direct vs Indirect Calls
user.logUser(); 
Calls logUser directly: "this" = 'user' : the function is invoked as a method of the 'user' object.

let logFn = user.logUser; 
logFn(); 
Calls logUser indirectly: "this" = global object : the function is called as a "standalone" function
